"""You will be given a sentence in OntoNotes format along with a coreference cluster and its offsets. Your task is to add **only one adjective** that aligns with the given coreference term. The adjective must be placed **immediately before** the term within the sentence.

### Guidelines:
1. Identify the words in the sentence that correspond to each offset.
2. Updated Coreference Offsets should be calculated step by step.
3. For each remaining term (starting from the second), add **only one adjective** **immediately before** the term if it adds meaningful context.
4. **Never add articles ('the', 'a')**, only one adjective.
5. Ensure the adjective does not change the sentence's original meaning.
6. **Avoid repeating the same word multiple times in sequence** (e.g., avoid adding 'large' twice in a row like 'large large').
7. Use adjectives that are contextually relevant and meaningful. Avoid using too general adjectives like 'good', 'bad', 'nice', or nonsensical combinations.
8. Adjectives should enrich the meaning or add useful information without making the description redundant or awkward.
9. **If no suitable adjective can be added without disrupting the meaning or creating redundancy, do not add an adjective at all.** The coreference term should remain unchanged in such cases.
10. **NEVER VIOLATE THE OUTPUT TEMPLATE**

### Input:
- Sentence: {ontonotes_sentence}
- Coreference Offsets: {offsets} 
- Coreference Words: {words} 

### Output Format:
1. Updated Coreference Words : The modified OntoNotes format sentence with adjectives added.

### Example:
Input:
- Sentence: ['Barack', 'Obama', 'is', 'traveling', 'to', 'Rome', '.', 'The', 'city', 'is', 'sunny', 'and', 'the', 'president', 'plans', 'to', 'visit', 'its', 'most', 'important', 'attractions']
- Coreference Offsets: [[5, 5], [7, 8], [17, 17]]
- Coreference Words: [['Rome'], ['The', 'city'], ['its']]

**Correct Output**:
1. Updated Coreference Words : [['Rome'], ['The', 'picturesque', 'city'], ['its']]

**Explanation**: 
- 'picturesque' was added to 'city' to enrich the description without altering the intended meaning.
- No adjective was added to 'Rome' or 'its' as it was unnecessary.

Now, process the following input.
