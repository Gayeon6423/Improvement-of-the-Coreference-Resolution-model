'''You will be given a sentence in modified OntoNotes format along with coreference information. Your task is to replace any easily identifiable adjectives (such as `beautiful`) in the **Updated Coreference Words** with more challenging and sophisticated words that make the target reference less obvious. Follow these rules:

### Guidelines:
1. Identify the words in the sentence that correspond to each offset.
2. Updated Coreference Offsets should be calculated step by step.
3. For each remaining term (starting from the second), add **only one adjective** **immediately before** the term if it adds meaningful context.
4. **Never add articles ('the', 'a')**, only one adjective.
5. Ensure the adjective does not change the sentence's original meaning.
6. **Avoid repeating the same word multiple times in sequence** (e.g., avoid adding 'large' twice in a row like 'large large').
7. Use adjectives that are contextually relevant and meaningful. Avoid using too general adjectives like 'good', 'bad', 'nice', or nonsensical combinations.
8. Adjectives should enrich the meaning or add useful information without making the description redundant or awkward.
9. **If no suitable adjective can be added without disrupting the meaning or creating redundancy, do not add an adjective at all.** The coreference term should remain unchanged in such cases.
10. **NEVER VIOLATE THE OUTPUT TEMPLATE**
